# Yes, I'm turning my passion into purpose

It has been said, "If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in
your life." While some people can't say this about their work, from now
on I'll do.

## Where it started

When I was a boy, my grandfather noticed my
drawing abilities and encouraged me. He was a carpenter in a small
village, and he taught me how to use a jigsaw, how to paint, and how to
file. It allowed me to take my drawings off the page and bring them to
life.

## Build Your Skills

It was the time spent working creatively with my
grandfather that made me choose to go to a creative school. My formal
design education began at Sint Lucas in Boxtel, Netherlands. Here is
where my earliest skills as a web designer and animation were formed.
The earliest project that really caught my interest was interactive
design. The movements themselves brought me great joy. This was all on
Adobe Flash, to add interaction you had to program, which seemed crazy
at the time!

Allow yourself to learn everything you can in that field and to make the
most of any opportunity that arises. I was fortunate to find a school
that I could go to, now the internet has made it possible to learn
almost anything from anywhere.

## Real World Experience

It was my enrollment in school that gave me the
opportunity to seek out an internship. Here is where I was able to put
what I was learning into application. I looked for a company that was
close to my home to make my travel easier. I ended up interning at
Compubase - a company that worked with Drupal, not Wordpress. I didn't
know Drupal at the time, but I was able to learn it quickly. Drupal is a
cms and one of the most popular alternatives to Wordpress. It's used to
make many of the websites and applications you use every day. This was
how I grew from web designer to website architect and builder. After
this work, flat design wasn't a challenge anymore, and I was ready for
more. That's when I discovered programming and the possibilities within
it.

## Passion to Purpose

Now that I had all the basic skills, I knew that I
could take on more advanced work. I got a position at a marketing
communication agency in Apeldoorn called Emotion. They were looking for
a "front-end developer for interaction". I found myself on a team with
five other like-minded individuals. There was a learning curve, I had to
re-learn a lot of techniques and styles at a much higher level.
Everything from Craft CMS to Vanilla JavaScript to Vue.js. Here is where
I started to discover the relationship between design and customer
experience, the meeting place of accessibility and search engine
optimization.

It's never too late to pursue a career in something you enjoy doing. If
you take the right steps and open the door when opportunity knocks, you
too can turn a passion into your purpose.
